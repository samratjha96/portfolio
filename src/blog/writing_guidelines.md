# Blog Writing Guidelines (for LLM consumption)

These guidelines help avoid AI-sounding writing when generating blog posts.

## Tone & Voice

- First-person, conversational
- Write like you're explaining to a coworker, not presenting to an audience
- Have opinions. It's okay to say something is annoying or that you prefer X over Y
- Admit when you messed up or wasted time on something

## Things to Avoid

### Transition phrases that scream AI
- "Here's how I did it"
- "The key insight:"
- "Let's dive in"
- "In this article, we will explore..."
- "That's it." (especially as a standalone sentence)
- "It just works"
- "Be honest about..."
- "Let me explain"
- "Here's the thing:"

### Structural tells
- Every section having a perfect 3-4 bullet list
- Before/after comparisons that read like marketing
- Too many superlatives ("fantastic", "incredibly", "dramatically")
- Wrapping up with a neat bow ("And that's how you...")
- Numbered lists for things that don't need numbers
- Em dashes everywhere. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

### Preachy/salesy patterns
- Telling the reader what they should feel or do
- Overselling benefits
- "You'll never have to worry about X again"
- Generic praise ("Workers are fantastic for this")

## Things to Include

### Human touches
- Actual frustrations: "I forgot this and got cryptic errors"
- Shortcuts you took: "Didn't want to deal with more infrastructure"
- Casual asides: "Types are nice."
- Incomplete sentences occasionally. Fine in casual writing.

### Practical value
- Real code examples from the actual project
- Specific gotchas you hit, not theoretical ones
- Links to source code so people can verify
- Honest limitations section (but don't be preachy about it)

## Structure

- Start with what you built and a link to it
- Don't over-explain motivation. One short paragraph max.
- Code examples should be minimal and runnable
- Gotchas section is often the most valuable part. Don't skip it.
- End with a link to source, not a conclusion paragraph

## Length

- Shorter is better
- If a section feels like filler, cut it
- Don't pad with obvious explanations
- Trust the reader to know basics

## Before Publishing Checklist

1. Read it back as a skeptical reader. Does any sentence make you cringe?
2. Search for phrases from the "avoid" list
3. Is there at least one moment of admitted frustration or imperfection?
4. Would you actually send this to a friend? Or does it feel like content?
