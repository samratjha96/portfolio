Frontend development continues to evolve at a rapid pace. As we move through 2025, several technologies have emerged as industry standards for building robust, performant, and maintainable web applications. In this post, I'll share my recommended tech stack for modern frontend development.

## The Core Technologies

At the heart of any modern frontend stack are three key technologies:

### React: The UI Library

React continues to dominate the frontend landscape in 2025. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM provide an excellent foundation for building complex user interfaces. With React 19's introduction of server components and streaming rendering, React applications are now more performant than ever.

```jsx
// Example of a modern React component using React 19 features
"use client";

import { useTransition } from "react";

export default function CommentForm() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const form = event.currentTarget;
    const formData = new FormData(form);

    startTransition(() => {
      // This update happens in a transition, improving perceived performance
      submitComment(formData);
    });
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="comment-form">
      <textarea name="comment" required />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit Comment"}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### TypeScript: The Type System

TypeScript has become the standard for JavaScript development. Its static type checking helps catch errors during development, improves code quality, and enhances developer experience with better tooling and documentation.

TypeScript is now used in over 85% of professional frontend projects, with adoption continuing to rise. The TypeScript ecosystem has matured significantly, with excellent support across libraries and frameworks.

### Tailwind CSS: The Styling Solution

Utility-first CSS has won the styling wars, with Tailwind CSS leading the charge. Its atomic approach to CSS allows for rapid UI development while maintaining a consistent design language.

```jsx
// Example of a modern UI card component using Tailwind CSS
function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
      <div className="p-5">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">{product.name}</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">{product.description}</p>
        <div className="mt-4 flex justify-between items-center">
          <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600">${product.price}</span>
          <button className="bg-indigo-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-indigo-700">
            Add to Cart
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## State Management

Redux was once the de facto standard for state management in React applications. However, in 2025, we have better options:

### React Query / TanStack Query

For server state, React Query (now known as TanStack Query) has become the industry standard. It handles caching, background updates, and stale data management with minimal configuration.

```jsx
// Example of using TanStack Query
import { useQuery, useMutation, queryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// Fetch products
function Products() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["products"],
    queryFn: fetchProducts,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {data.map((product) => (
        <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Zustand

For client-side state, Zustand provides a simple yet powerful API that works well with React's rendering model. It's lightweight, unopinionated, and easy to integrate with TypeScript.

```jsx
// Example of a Zustand store
import create from "zustand";

const useCartStore = create((set) => ({
  items: [],
  totalItems: 0,
  totalPrice: 0,
  addItem: (item) =>
    set((state) => {
      const newItems = [...state.items, item];
      return {
        items: newItems,
        totalItems: newItems.length,
        totalPrice: newItems.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0),
      };
    }),
  removeItem: (itemId) =>
    set((state) => {
      const newItems = state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId);
      return {
        items: newItems,
        totalItems: newItems.length,
        totalPrice: newItems.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0),
      };
    }),
}));
```

## Build Tools

Build tooling has been simplified dramatically in recent years, with Vite emerging as the clear winner.

### Vite

Vite offers lightning-fast startup times, hot module replacement, and optimized builds out of the box. It supports TypeScript, JSX, CSS modules, and more without requiring complex configuration.

## Deployment & Hosting

Modern frontend applications are increasingly deployed as static sites with dynamic capabilities powered by APIs and serverless functions.

### Vercel / Netlify

Platforms like Vercel and Netlify provide excellent developer experiences with features like:

- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Automatic HTTPS
- Edge functions
- Global CDN
- Analytics and monitoring

## Full-Stack Frameworks

While React remains the dominant UI library, full-stack frameworks built on top of React have gained significant traction.

### Next.js

Next.js continues to be the leading React framework, offering:

- Server components
- Streaming rendering
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in image optimization
- API routes and serverless functions
- Middleware support
- Optimized data fetching

```jsx
// Example of a modern Next.js page
// app/products/[id]/page.tsx
export default async function ProductPage({ params }) {
  // This runs on the server
  const product = await fetchProduct(params.id);

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{product.name}</h1>
      <ProductDetails product={product} />
      <AddToCartButton productId={product.id} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing

A comprehensive testing strategy includes multiple testing types:

### Vitest

Vitest has replaced Jest as the go-to unit testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Its integration with Vite provides much faster test execution.

### Testing Library

Testing Library remains the standard for component testing, promoting user-centric testing practices. It encourages testing behavior rather than implementation details.

```jsx
// Example of component testing with Vitest and Testing Library
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import { expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import AddToCartButton from "./AddToCartButton";

test("calls onAddToCart when clicked", async () => {
  const mockAddToCart = vi.fn();
  render(<AddToCartButton productId="123" onAddToCart={mockAddToCart} />);

  const button = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /add to cart/i });
  await fireEvent.click(button);

  expect(mockAddToCart).toHaveBeenCalledWith("123");
});
```

### Playwright

For end-to-end testing, Playwright has emerged as the leader due to its cross-browser support, reliability, and powerful APIs.

## Conclusion

The modern frontend stack has matured significantly in recent years. By combining React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the other technologies mentioned in this post, developers can build robust, performant, and maintainable web applications.

As we continue through 2025, we can expect these technologies to evolve further, with a focus on performance, developer experience, and accessibility. The key to success is finding the right balance between adopting new technologies and maintaining stability in your projects.
